# Horiseon Refactor

## Here I have taken existing code, and condensed it, ensured that all links are working properly, added some more applicable syntax (to help future developers understand the content better), and added accessability features in order to better serve any users who may have trouble navigating the webpage. I have basically stremlined the code in order to help everything run smoothly! Afterall, clean code is happy code! This project has helped me to better understand my career field, which is of course why I chose this undertaking in the first place. Happy coding!
